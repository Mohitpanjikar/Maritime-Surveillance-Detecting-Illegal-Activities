# Maritime-Surveillance-Detecting-Illegal-Activities

This framework is designed for real-time monitoring and detection of illegal maritime activities using vessel behavior analysis, expert rule fusion, and advanced machine learning techniques. The system employs AI models such as RNNs, CNNs, and GANs to analyze vessel data and detect anomalous behavior. It also integrates a React-based frontend for real-time data visualization and a robust database for storing historical maritime activity.
